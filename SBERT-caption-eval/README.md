## Standard Diversity 

**Div-n** and **mblue**  from [Speaking the Same Language: Matching Machine to Human Captions by Adversarial Training](https://github.com/rakshithShetty/captionGAN)

``` 
 python2 computeDivStats.py beam_sample.json
```

Vocabulary size

```
python voc_size.py --hyp beam.txt 
``` 
## Lexical Diversity 

First, [install the packages](https://pypi.org/project/lexicalrichness/) by``pip install lexicalrichness`` 

For Uniq tokens per caption  

```
Lexical Diversity/uniq_token.sh
``` 

For MTLD  

```
Lexical Diversity/MTLD.sh
``` 
For TTR  

```
